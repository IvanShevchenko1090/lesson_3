                <article><mark>Information technology</mark> (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve, and
                    exchange all kinds of data and information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or
                    entertainment technologies. IT forms part of information and communications technology (ICT).<mark> An information
                    technology system (IT system)</mark> is generally an information system, a communications system, or, more
                    specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited
                    group of IT users.
                    <br>
                    Although humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the earliest
                    writing systems were developed, the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article
                    published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new
                    technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT)." Their
                    definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical
                    methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.
                    The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other
                    information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are
                    associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors,
                    internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce.
                    <br>
                    Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT
                    development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC — 1450 AD), mechanical (1450—1840), electromechanical (1840—1940), and
                    electronic (1940 to present). This article focuses on the most recent period (electronic).
                    <br>
                    Information technology is also a branch of computer science, which can be defined as the overall study of procedure,
                    structure, and the processing of various types of data. As this field continues to evolve across the world, the
                    overall priority and importance has also grown, which is where we begin to see the introduction of computer science-related
                    courses in K-12 education. However, concerns have been raised about this fact that most schools are lacking
                    advanced-placement courses in this field.

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)" title="replica on display at Deutsches Museum in Munich. The Zuse Z3 is the first programmable computer">Zuse Z3</a>
                </div>
                <br>
                <article>Ideas of computer science were first mentioned before the 1950s under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
            and Harvard University, where they had discussed and began thinking of computer circuits and numerical calculations. As
            time went on, the field of information technology and computer science became more complex and was able to handle the
            processing of more data. Scholarly articles began to be published from different organizations. 
            <br>
            Looking at early computing, Alan Turing, J. Presper Eckert, and John Mauchly were considered to be some of the major
            pioneers of computer technology in the mid-1900s. Giving them such credit for their developments, most of their efforts
            were focused on designing the first digital computer. Along with that, topics such as artificial intelligence began to
            be brought up as Turing was beginning to question such technology of the time period. 
            <br>
            Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a tally stick. 
            The Antikythera mechanism, dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered to be the
            earliest known mechanical analog computer, and the earliest known geared mechanism. Comparable geared devices did
            not emerge in Europe until the 16th century, and it was not until 1645 that the first mechanical calculator capable of
            performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed. 
            <br>
            Electronic computers, using either relays or valves, began to appear in the early 1940s. The electromechanical Zuse Z3,
            completed in 1941, was the world's first programmable computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines that
            could be considered a complete computing machine. During the Second World War, Colossus developed the first electronic
            digital computer to decrypt German messages. Although it was programmable, it was not general-purpose, being designed to
            perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory; programming was carried out using
            plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring.  The first recognizably modern electronic digital stored-program
            computer was the Manchester Baby, which ran its first program on 21 June 1948. 
            <br>
            The development of transistors in the late 1940s at Bell Laboratories allowed a new generation of computers to be
            designed with greatly reduced power consumption. The first commercially available stored-program computer, the Ferranti
            Mark I, contained 4050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. By comparison, the first transistorized
            computer developed at the University of Manchester and operational by November 1953, consumed only 150 watts in its
            final version. 
            <br>
            Several other breakthroughs in semiconductor technology include the integrated circuit (IC) invented by Jack Kilby at
            Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959, the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
            transistor (MOSFET) invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Laboratories in 1959, and the microprocessor
            invented by Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin, Masatoshi Shima, and Stanley Mazor at Intel in 1971. These important inventions
            led to the development of the personal computer (PC) in the 1970s, and the emergence of information and communications
            technology (ICT). 
            <br>
            By the year of 1984, according to the National Westminster Bank Quarterly Review, the term 'information technology' had
            been redefined as "The development of cable television was made possible by the convergence of telecommunications and
            computing technology (…generally known in Britain as information technology).” We then begin to see the appearance of
            the term in 1990 contained within documents for the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). 
            <br>
            Innovations in technology have already revolutionized the world by the twenty-first century as people were able to
            access different online services. This has changed the workforce drastically as thirty percent of U.S. workers were
            already in careers of this profession. 136.9 million people were personally connected to the Internet, which was
            equivalent to 51 million households.  Along with Internet, new types of technology were also being introduced across
            the globe, which has improved efficiency and made things easier across the globe.buyers.
            <br>
            Along with technology revolutionizing society, millions of processes could be done in seconds. Innovations in
            communication were also crucial as people began to rely on the computer to communicate through telephone lines and
            cable. The introduction of email was a really big thing as "companies in one part of the world could communicate by
            e-mail with suppliers and buyers in another part of the world..." 
            <br>
            Not only personally, computers and technology have also revolutionized the marketing industry, resulting in more buyers
            of their products. During the year of 2002, Americans have exceeded $28 billion in goods just over the Internet alone
            when e-commerce a decade later resulted in $289 billion in sales.  And as computers are rapidly becoming more
            sophisticated by the day, they are becoming more used as people are becoming more reliant on them during the
                twenty-first century.</article>

                <h3>Data Storage</h3>
                <h6>Main article: Data storage</h6>
                <article>Early electronic computers such as Colossus made use of punched tape, a long strip of paper on which data was
                    represented by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete. Electronic data storage, which is used in modern
                    computers, dates from World War II, when a form of delay-line memory was developed to remove the clutter from radar
                    signals, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line. The first random-access digital
                    storage device was the Williams tube, which was based on a standard cathode ray tube. However, the information
                    stored in it and delay-line memory was volatile in the fact that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was
                    lost once power was removed. The earliest form of non-volatile computer storage was the magnetic drum, invented in
                    1932
                    and used in the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.
                    IBM introduced the first hard disk drive in 1956, as a component of their 305 RAMAC computer system. : 6  Most
                    digital data today is still stored magnetically on hard disks, or optically on media such as CD-ROMs. : 4–5  Until
                    2002 most information was stored on analog devices, but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the
                    first time. As of 2007, almost 94% of the data stored worldwide was held digitally: 52% on hard disks, 28% on
                    optical
                    devices, and 11% on digital magnetic tape. It has been estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on
                    electronic devices grew from less than 3 exabytes in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007, doubling roughly every 3
                    years.

                <h3>Databases</h3>
                <h6>Main article: Database</h6>
                <article>Database Management Systems (DMS) emerged in the 1960s to address the problem of storing and retrieving large
                    amounts of data accurately and quickly. An early such system was IBM's Information Management System (IMS), which is
                    still
                    widely deployed more than 50 years later. IMS stores data hierarchically, but in the 1970s Ted Codd proposed an
                    alternative relational storage model based on set theory and predicate logic and the familiar concepts of tables,
                    rows, and columns. In 1981, the first commercially available relational database management system (RDBMS) was
                    released by
                    Oracle.
                    <br>
                    All DMS consist of components, they allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while
                    maintaining its integrity. All databases are common in one point that the structure of the data they contain is
                    defined and stored separately from the data itself, in a database schema.
                    <br>
                    In recent years, the extensible markup language (XML) has become a popular format for data representation. Although
                    XML data can be stored in normal file systems, it is commonly held in relational databases to take advantage of
                    their
                    "robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort." As an evolution of the Standard
                    Generalized Markup Language (SGML), XML's text-based structure offers the advantage of being both machine and
                    human-readable.

                <article>The relational database model introduced a programming-language independent Structured
                    Query Language (SQL), based on relational algebra.
                    <br>
                    The terms "data" and "information" are not synonymous. Anything stored is data, but it only becomes information when
                    it
                    is organized and presented meaningfully. : 1–9  Most of the world's digital data is unstructured, and stored in a
                    variety of different physical formats even within a single organization. Data warehouses began to be developed in
                    the 1980s to integrate these disparate stores. They typically contain data extracted from various sources, including
                    external sources such as the Internet, organized in such a way as to facilitate decision support systems
                    (DSS). 40]: 4–6

                <h3>Data Transmission</h3>
                <article>Data transmission has three aspects: transmission, propagation, and reception. It can be broadly categorized as
                    broadcasting, in which information is transmitted unidirectionally downstream, or telecommunications, with
                    bidirectional
                    upstream and downstream channels.
                    XML has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the early 2000s, particularly for
                    machine-oriented interactions such as those involved in web-oriented protocols such as SOAP, describing
                    "data-in-transit rather than... data-at-rest". </article>

                <article>Hilbert and Lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change (a kind of Moore's law): machines'
                    application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and
                    2007;
                    <br>
                    the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two
                    decades;
                    <br>
                    the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; the world's storage capacity per capita
                    required roughly 40 months to double (every 3 years); and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 12.3

                    Massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day, but unless it can be analyzed and presented effectively it
                    essentially resides in what have been called data tombs: "data archives that are seldom visited". To address that
                    issue, the field of data mining — "the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts
                    of data" — emerged in the late 1980s.

                <article>As technology is becoming more sophisticated by the day, there are increasing problems for security as everyone
                    relies on storing information into computers more than ever. With data and databases becoming more dependent in

                    Along with IT Departments and personnel, there are also different types of agencies that "strengthen" the workforce.

                    organizations have all of the different necessities to add infrastructure and security to protect them in the future from the
                    different challenges that may lie head. Branching off of the DHS, many programs are in place as well to build
                    cybersecurity awareness across the organization or workforce.</article>

                <h3>Email</h3>
                <article>The technology and services it provides for sending and receiving electronic messages (called "letters" or
                    "electronic letters") over a distributed (including global) computer network. In terms of the composition of elements and the
                    principle of operation, electronic mail practically repeats the system of regular (paper) mail, borrowing both terms
                    (mail, letter, envelope, attachment, box, delivery, and others) and characteristic features — ease of use, message
                    transmission delays, sufficient reliability and at the same time no guarantee of delivery. The advantages of e-mail
                    are: easily perceived and remembered by a person addresses of the form user__name@domain__name (for example,
                    somebody@example.com); the ability to transfer both plain text and formatted, as well as arbitrary files;
                    independence of servers (in the general case, they address each other directly); sufficiently high reliability of message
                    delivery; ease of use by humans and programs.
                    <br>
                    Disadvantages of e-mail: the presence of such a phenomenon as spam (massive advertising and viral mailings); the
                    theoretical impossibility of guaranteed delivery of a particular letter; possible delays in message delivery (up to
                    several days); limits on the size of one message and on the total size of messages in the mailbox (personal for
                    users).

                <h3>Search System</h3>
                <article>A software and hardware complex with a web interface that provides the ability to search for information on the
                    Internet. A search engine usually means a site that hosts the interface (front-end) of the system. The software part
                    of
                    a search engine is a search engine (search engine) — a set of programs that provides the functionality of a search
                    engine and is usually a trade secret of the search engine developer company. Most search engines look for
                    information on
                    World Wide Web sites, but there are also systems that can look for files on FTP servers, items in online stores, and
                    information on Usenet newsgroups. Improving search is one of the priorities of the modern Internet (see the Deep Web
                    article about the main problems in the work of search engines).
                    <br>
                    According to Statista, in October 2021, search engine usage was distributed as follows:
                    <div class="services__search-systems">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Google — 86,64%;</li>
                            <li>Bing — 7%;</li>
                            <li>Yahoo! — 2.75%.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    According to Statcounter Global Stats for August 2021, in Asia, the Chinese resource Baidu managed to take almost 3%
                    of
                    the Internet market. In turn, Yandex in the same region bypassed Yahoo, receiving a share of almost 2% and third
                    place
                    in the ranking.

                <div class="perspective__academic" id="academic">
                <h3>Academic Perspective</h3>
                <article>In an academic context, the Association for Computing Machinery defines Information Technology as
                    "undergraduate degree
                    programs that prepare students to meet the computer technology needs of business, government, healthcare, schools,
                    and
                    other kinds of organizations IT specialists assume responsibility for selecting hardware and software products
                    appropriate for an organization, integrating those products with organizational needs and infrastructure, and
                    installing, customizing, and maintaining those applications for the organization’s computer users."
                    <br>
                    Undergraduate degrees in IT (B.S., A.S.) are similar to other computer science degrees. In fact, they oftentimes
                    have
                    the same foundational level courses. Computer science (CS) programs tend to focus more on theory and design, whereas
                    Information Technology programs are structured to equip the graduate with expertise in the practical application of
                    technology solutions to support modern business and user needs.
                    <br>
                    However this not true in all cases. For example, in India an engineering degree in Information Technology (B.Tech
                    IT) is
                    a 4-year professional course and it is considered as an equivalent degree to a degree in Computer Science and
                    Engineering since they share strikingly similar syllabus across many universities in India.
                    <br>
                    B.Tech IT degree focuses heavily on mathematical foundations of computer science since students are taught calculus,
                    linear algebra, graph theory and discrete mathematics in first two years. B.Tech. IT program also contains core
                    computer
                    science courses like Data Structures, Algorithm Analysis And Design, Compiler Design, Automata Theory, Computer
                    Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networks etc.[55][56][original research?] And the graduate level entrance
                    examination which is required for masters in engineering in India-GATE-is common for both CS and IT undergraduates.

                    <h3>Commercial and Employment Perspective</h3>
                    <article>Companies in the information technology field are often discussed as a group as the "tech sector" or the "tech
                        industry." These titles can be misleading at times and should not be mistaken for “tech companies;" which
                        are generally large scale, for-profit corporations that sell consumer technology and software. It is also worth
                        noting that from a business perspective, Information Technology departments are a “cost center” the majority of the time. A
                        cost center is a department or staff which incurs expenses, or “costs," within a company rather than generating
                        profits or revenue streams. Modern businesses rely heavily on technology for their day-to-day operations, so the expenses
                        delegated to cover technology that facilitates business in a more efficient manner are usually seen as “just the
                        cost of doing business." IT departments are allocated funds by senior leadership and must attempt to achieve the desired
                        deliverables while staying within that budget. Government and the private sector might have different funding
                        mechanisms, but the principles are more-or-less the same. This is an often overlooked reason for the rapid interest
                        in automation and Artificial Intelligence, but the constant pressure to do more with less is opening the door for
                        automation to take control of at least some minor operations in large companies.
                        <br>
                        Many companies now have IT departments for managing the computers, networks, and other technical areas of their
                        businesses. Companies have also sought to integrate IT with business outcomes and decision-making through a BizOps
                        or business operations department.
                        <br>
                        In a business context, the Information Technology Association of America has defined information technology as "the
                        study, design, development, application, implementation, support, or management of computer-based information
                        systems".The responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration, software
                        development and installation, and the planning and management of an organization's technology life cycle, by which
                        hardware and software are maintained, upgraded, and replaced.
